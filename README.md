# Synthesis and Summary of the Lab
Part 1: Language Modeling / Regression

Throughout this lab, I engaged in a comprehensive exercise involving natural language processing (NLP) and regression modeling techniques. Hereâ€™s a detailed synthesis of what I learned and the key results obtained:

Key Learnings:
Preprocessing Text Data:

Tokenization, Stemming, and Lemmatization: I learned how to break down text into tokens, reduce words to their base forms using stemming and lemmatization, and remove stop words to prepare the data for modeling.
Discretization: Applied techniques to discretize continuous variables if necessary, although this was more relevant to classification tasks.
Encoding Techniques:

Word2Vec (CBOW and Skip-Gram): Implemented Word2Vec models to generate word embeddings that capture semantic meanings of words.
Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF: Used BoW and TF-IDF to create numerical representations of text data, which are essential for feeding into machine learning models.
Regression and Classification Models:

Linear Regression: Applied Linear Regression to predict continuous outcomes. Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Naive Bayes: Although Naive Bayes is typically used for classification, I explored its application and evaluated its performance in classifying text data into categories.
Model Evaluation:

Regression Metrics: Evaluated Linear Regression using MSE, RMSE, and R-squared score. The results were:
Mean Squared Error: 2.5865523262524026
Root Mean Squared Error: 1.6082761971292128
R-squared Score: -1.1193250554250582
Classification Metrics: For Naive Bayes, I generated a classification report that included precision, recall, and F1-score for different categories (high, low, medium). The key findings were:
High precision and recall for the 'high' category, indicating the model's effectiveness in identifying this category.
Poor performance in identifying 'low' and 'medium' categories, reflected in low precision, recall, and F1-scores for these classes.
Interpretation and Conclusion:

Linear Regression: The high MSE and negative R-squared score indicate that the model did not fit the data well. This suggests that a simple linear model may not capture the complexity of the text data.
Naive Bayes: The high accuracy for the 'high' category but poor performance for 'low' and 'medium' categories indicates an imbalance in class representation and a potential need for further tuning or alternative modeling approaches.
Summary:
Overall, this lab provided valuable insights into the practical application of NLP preprocessing techniques, the use of various encoding methods to prepare text data for machine learning, and the implementation and evaluation of both regression and classification models.

Preprocessing: Mastered essential NLP preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare text data.
Model Implementation: Successfully implemented and evaluated Linear Regression and Naive Bayes models.
Model Evaluation: Learned to use key metrics to assess model performance and identify areas for improvement.
Key Results:
Linear Regression:
Mean Squared Error: 2.5865523262524026
Root Mean Squared Error: 1.6082761971292128
R-squared Score: -1.1193250554250582
Naive Bayes Classification Report:
High precision and recall for the 'high' category but poor performance for 'low' and 'medium' categories, highlighting the need for handling imbalanced classes and potentially using more sophisticated models for better performance.
This lab has equipped me with the foundational skills and knowledge to preprocess text data, apply various machine learning models, and critically evaluate their performance. Going forward, I can explore more advanced techniques and algorithms to further enhance model accuracy and robustness.
